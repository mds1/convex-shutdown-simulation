# Convex System Shutdown Benchmarks

This repository benchmarks performance of various Ethereum development
frameworks by simulating a call to Convex's `systemShutdown` method. This method
uses about 16M gas and performs a number of token transfers

To run tests, make sure you have an environment variable called `ETH_RPC_URL`.
Then use the following test commands:

- Hardhat: `yarn` then `yarn hardhat test --no-compile`
- Dapptools: `dapp update` then `dapp test --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL`
- Foundry: `forge test --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL`
- Ganache v7 (@beta): `yarn` then `yarn benchmark:ganache`

Installation instructions for forge and dapptools can be found
[here](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/) and
[here](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/) respectively.
